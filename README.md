# Description
Extended Platform Placement is a mod that makes platforms placed like how ropes do. Trying to place a platform where one already exists will extend the platform to the direction your character is facing.

There are 5 modes that decides how the platforms are extended. Set a hotkey to swap modes.
- Auto: The slope of the platform is decided by the slope of the one at the cursor. Set by default.
- Horizontal: Only extends platforms horizontally.
- Upward: Always extends platforms upward.
- Downward: Always extends platforms downward.
- Off: Does not extend platforms(no mod effect).

You can choose several options via config.
- Smart Platform Check: Decide whether this mod affects all items that 'seem' to be a platform, or only items that Terraria says to be platforms.
- Faster Placement: Make the extension extremely faster. 

# Currently known issues
- Platforms are extended outside the boundary.
